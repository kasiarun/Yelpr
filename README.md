#Yelpr - A Titanium Mobile Example

Yelpr is a simple example application which uses Yelp.com web services to display
business review data in and around the device's current location.

To use Yelpr, sign up for an API key at Yelp.com and replace it in the variable
named `api_key` in Resources/js/results.js
